# denton

Denton is simple persistence middleware for Clojure. It supplies a basic protocol, `Persistable`, and structures
related concerns like logging, SQL parsing, object mapping, and lifecycle events as a series of wrappers applied
to a core implementation of that protocol, much like Ring does with HTTP requests.

Denton is designed to be lightweight but has strong opinions about logging (essential), raw SQL (avoid), and macros
with side effects (avoid at all costs). It does not provide any infrastructure for managing "models", but does include
several helpful faculties that `clojure.jdbc` leaves out.

The base `Persistable` protocol defines six functions:

* `update-all`: Given a query and a map of values, updates the record and returns the updated values.
* `insert`: Given a map of values, inserts the record and returns the updated values.
* `delete`: Given a query, deletes all records that match it and returns the number affected.
* `find-one`: Given a query, returns the first record matching it.
* `find-all`: Given a query, returns all records matching it.
* `count-all` Given a query, returns the count of records matching it.

In addition, Denton defines several other user-friendly helper functions, like `save`, that act on reified persistables.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[denton.core :refer :all])

(def users
  (-> (sql-db env/database-url)
      (wrap-with-honey "users")
      (wrap-with-logging println "users")
      (wrap-with-serialize case/->snake_case_keyword case/->camelCaseKeyword)
      (wrap-with-lifecycle {:after-delete #(chatbot/notify "User " (:id %) " deleted")})
      ))

(find-all users [:= :id 1])                  #=> [{:id 1 ...}]
(find-by-id users 1)                         #=> {:id 1 ...}
(save users {:name "Guybrush Threepwood"})   #=> {:id 3 :name "Guybrush Threepwood"}
(save users {:id 1 :name "Herman Toothrot"}) #=> {:id 3 :name "Herman Toothrot"}
```
